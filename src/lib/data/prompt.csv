Succinctly analyze all California cities of tourist importance and provide tourism data in a table format as shown below:

CityName|Reviews|Transit|Safety|Core Appeal|Metro Draw|Rating

Metrics:

Reviews: Total count (K/M) - Reflects popularity.

Transit (0-100): Public transport quality.

Safety (0-100): Based on crime statistics and perceived safety.

Core Appeal (0-100): The city's inherent attractiveness to tourists (natural beauty, unique offerings, cultural significance). This is the primary driver of the overall rating.

Metro Draw (0-100): How much the city benefits from being part of a larger metropolitan area. A secondary factor.

Rating (0-5): Overall tourist experience rating. Focus on accurately reflecting each city's appeal based on the metrics, especially Core Appeal. Do not force the ratings into a specific distribution (e.g., a bell curve). Multiple cities can have similar ratings if they genuinely offer a comparable quality of tourist experience.

Reference Cities (for context):

Venice: 800K Reviews, Transit: 65, Safety: 75, Core Appeal: 95, Metro Draw: 20, Rating: 4.8

Gary, Indiana: 50K Reviews, Transit: 30, Safety: 35, Core Appeal: 20, Metro Draw: 50, Rating: 2.1

DO NOT provide a justification, summary of the simply. Simply the scores, for as many cities as possible within that jurisdicition.

Sort by Rating (descending). Prioritize accurate representation over forced statistical patterns.
